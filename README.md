This is a projct to provide a 3rd party alerting agent for SparkPost events.
The concept is to capture a webhooks feed of events, store them and then alow a user to set reports and triggered alarms based off the data captured.  IE: daily delivery report, or a triggered alarm for 30& bounce rate on Yahoo, etc...
